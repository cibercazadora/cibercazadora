- 👋 Hi, I’m @cibercazadora (cyberhuntress in Spanish). I'm a Cuban-Mexican American, a military brat, and a proud USAF vet.
- 👀 I’m interested in faith, family, cybersecurity, baking, working out inconsistently, occasional drawing and painting, light gaming, rollercoasters, astronomy, geology, and sci-fi. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to always learn and grow in cybersecurity, mentor, and collaborate with others.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is connecting with me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/p-g-lopez.
- My webpage is https://cibercazadora.github.io/. There you will find my CV, cybersec and sys engineering notes, and blog. 
- If you like my content, buy me coffee. https://www.buymeacoffee.com/pglopez
